# Serein extensions

The extension SDK and the official theme and plugin catalog for Serein. Plugins build
against the one [SDK](sdk); the [authoring guide](../examples/extensions/README.md)
covers writing your own.

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `sdk/` | The extension SDK every plugin builds against |
| `pack.py` | Packages a manifest and a built Wasm module |
| `themes/` | Declarative theme packages |
| `plugins/<id>/` | Plugin source and manifest ([build instructions](plugins/README.md)) |
| `plugins/packages/` | Reviewed plugin packages clients install |
| `previews/` | Catalog preview images ([provenance](previews/README.md)) |
| `catalog.json` | Generated; never edit by hand |

`catalog.json` lists each package's manifest, exact byte length, SHA-256 hash and an
immutable URL pinned to a full commit on `main`. The client reads it from `main`,
downloads package data only, and verifies every hash before installing. It never
clones this repository or runs build scripts. Capabilities and updates go through the
client's explicit consent flow.

## Publishing a package

1. Edit a theme under `themes/` or plugin source under `plugins/`. Preserve
   `manifest.id` and bump `manifest.version` for any changed package.
2. For a plugin, rebuild and repackage it under `plugins/packages/` (see
   [plugins/README.md](plugins/README.md)). The source and packaged manifests must match.
3. Optionally add a PNG preview under `previews/` with the package's file stem.
4. Open a pull request. CI validates every package, manifest and preview
   (`python3 catalog.py --validate`), builds the plugins and runs them in the host sandbox.
5. After merge, the [catalog workflow](../.github/workflows/extension-catalog.yml) runs
   `catalog.py --pin` on the merged commit and commits the regenerated catalog to `main`.
   Pull requests are squash-merged, so only a commit on `main` is a durable pin.

Do not commit `catalog.json` changes in a pull request. To check a catalog locally
against its pinned commit, run `python3 catalog.py --check`; `python3 test_catalog.py`
covers the validator itself.

Catalog tooling uses only Python's standard library. It checks identities,
capabilities/actions, byte bounds, plugin Wasm headers, source manifests, previews and
hashes. It intentionally does not duplicate Serein's theme schema or Wasm sandbox
validation: the client runs `extensions::parse_package` and sandbox checks before
installation, and CI runs the committed packages through the same code.

PNG previews share the package file stem and must fit 256 KiB. Full-size covers stay
embedded in their packages.

## History

These packages were maintained in `ViceVerse-cz/Serein-extensions` until they moved
here. That repository's catalog and package URLs remain valid for clients released
before the move. Manifest `source` links that point there are part of the reviewed
package bytes and change only with a new package version.

## Imported plugin build evidence

The remaining original plugin builds from the locked extension workspace with Rust 1.98.1 for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
Emoji & Sticker Images has been retired; its behavior is built into the client.
The imported Message delete protector contains 115,250 bytes of Wasm; the current source/SDK builds 70,629 bytes and does not reproduce that older artifact byte-for-byte.
The existing distributed package is intentionally preserved. A future release should review and version a rebuilt artifact together with its source; this import is not a claim of reproducibility for that older package.

These measurements used the standalone SDK copy that the plugins built against before
the move. All three remaining plugins now build against the in-repository SDK, so rebuilt sizes may
differ; the committed packages are unchanged. The Custom Rich Presence catalog preview
is the native editor rendered with synthetic offline data, not live Discord
compatibility evidence.

## Provenance and licenses

Package bytes and stable IDs are preserved from the existing client/theme repository:

- Nine original themes, two plugin packages, their Rust source/SDK/build files, and Ocean preview originate from `ViceVerse-cz/Serein` at `9e6bbcdef06b997ee3de3e228b2f2a54c940b7d0`.
- Forest Piano and Soft White originate from the owner's desktop packages normalized for Serein import at `a217f86c56b13ee51c4eb956f235b13eafb7609f`.
- All eleven theme packages are also recorded in `ViceVerse-cz/Serein-themes` at `6d2a97be4f8b0040aa9eada5648bceff55acb612`.
- Existing authors, license labels, and source URLs remain in every manifest. Serein's MIT and Apache-2.0 notices are retained at the repository root and do not replace individual artwork terms.
- Forest Piano and Soft White retain supplied `CC0-1.0` metadata; this is not independent verification of image rights. Consult their original sources for artwork provenance.

This repository does not relicense third-party artwork or assert additional redistribution rights.
