# Channel and message pills — issue #576

Baseline: `38d919d74054b885b992ce607f0bfa93ab449696`; runtime used for the
screenshots and process comparison: `78de8d15`. The original checkout's
untracked `community-extensions/` was preserved in a separate checkout. Both
comparison builds use the new synthetic `channel-links` fixture and the same
one-edge Cargo.lock repair: gpu-allocator 0.28.0 selects windows 0.62.2, matching
wgpu-hal 30.0.1. The untouched lockfile cannot build that Windows renderer because
it selects incompatible windows 0.61.3 types. No other baseline UI code changed.

## Reproduce the render

Use pinned Rust 1.98.1 and separate baseline/changed worktrees. In each worktree:

```powershell
cargo build --release --locked -p serein --features demo --example profile_preview
$preview = Join-Path $env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR 'release/examples/profile_preview.exe'
& $preview --demo --page=channel-links --width=1120 --height=900 --output=target/pills-dark.png
& $preview --demo --page=channel-links --width=720 --height=900 --light --output=target/pills-light-narrow.png
```

Set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to an absolute build-cache directory first (or use
`target/release/examples/profile_preview.exe` without that variable). Serialize
builds that share a target directory, and preserve each comparison executable
before building the other revision.

The fixture contains all four channel kinds and four message-link variants,
unknown destinations, a long Czech/Japanese post title, a named link, code and a
hidden spoiler. It uses no service adapters, credentials or live account data.
Images are eframe/WGPU framebuffer exports at 125% display scale, not OS window
captures. The native Computer Use helper failed to connect to its pipe with
`os error 2`; Orca was not installed. Native pointer/keyboard and screen-reader
operation remain unverified. Synthetic egui input/accessibility-tree tests are
separate evidence.

Both dark/wide and light/narrow pairs were inspected. The corrected capture has
uniform icon/text backgrounds, correct channel-type and message suffix icons,
the forum/post breadcrumb and a synthetic foreign-server avatar. Long multilingual
labels wrap inside the message column. Named links and hidden spoilers retain
their existing behavior.

## Process measurements

Windows 11 Home 10.0.26200, Ryzen 7 7800X3D (16 logical CPUs), 33,410,678,784 bytes
physical RAM; NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti and AMD integrated graphics are available. The
preview uses the existing WGPU renderer; its selected GPU/backend was not logged.

Run `sample-process.ps1 -Executable <absolute-preview-path> -Output <json-path>`
once per build. It launches only `--demo`, warms up for five seconds, then samples
21 times at approximately one-second intervals using actual elapsed wall time.
CPU is the process CPU-seconds delta divided by elapsed seconds (one-core
percentage); working set and private bytes come from Windows process counters.
This is a static idle fixture. No scripted scrolling or native input is claimed.
Compiler activity on the shared machine introduces noise. Frame latency,
startup latency and live Discord performance are unmeasured.

| Process metric | Baseline | After | Delta | Method |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| CPU, one-core percentage | 0.00% | 0.31% | +0.31 percentage points | Process CPU delta / elapsed time |
| Peak / settled working set | 196,276,224 B | 198,307,840 B | +2,031,616 B / +1.04% | WorkingSet64; maximum / mean of last five samples |
| Settled private bytes | 414,261,248 B | 415,698,944 B | +1,437,696 B / +0.35% | PrivateMemorySize64; mean of last five samples |

Settled means the mean of the last five samples. Baseline elapsed sample time was
20.536 s; after was 20.252 s. One sample series per build supports no performance
improvement claim; raw counters and summary are committed alongside this file.

Standard packages use `cargo xtask package`, without demo/developer features and
with voice included. Baseline and changed `dist` directories are kept separate.
Package bytes are the sum of files; compressed bytes use PowerShell
`Compress-Archive -Path dist/* -CompressionLevel Optimal`. No package executable
is launched with a saved session.

Both standard production packages passed, with voice included and without demo
or developer features. Package measurements:

| Metric | Baseline | After | Delta | Method |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Executable | 85,449,728 B | 85,464,064 B | +14,336 B / +0.017% | serein.exe file length |
| Installed files | 89,623,341 B | 89,637,677 B | +14,336 B / +0.016% | Sum of dist file lengths |
| ZIP distribution | 49,775,655 B | 49,781,438 B | +5,783 B / +0.012% | Compress-Archive, Optimal; ZIP file length |

NSIS is unavailable locally, so packaging produces an unsigned directory rather
than an installer executable. The standard build emitted the existing OpenH264
duplicate-object debug-info linker warning.

## Verification limits

The unchanged baseline UI suite has eight failures: six tests require empty
platform output commands, and two emoji tests expect unescaped underscore
labels. The task suite reproduces those failures. Native OS input/capture,
macOS/Linux runtime behavior and live Discord compatibility are unverified.
These prevent treating this change as ready to merge.

`cargo xtask check` reached 1,154 passed, 8 baseline failures, 23 ignored. The
changed UI suite had 414 passed, 8 baseline failures, 5 ignored. After the final
background-only correction, all seven focused pill tests and strict workspace
Clippy passed again. Formatting, production-only checking and policy checks also
passed. See `checks.json` for the exact baseline failure names.

## Review follow-up

`f9e568c9` fixes biography destination metadata, localizes accessible labels,
shares the renderer's source limit with metadata fingerprints, and adds table
methods. `7d9c0d05` distinguishes Chinese thread and post labels. Ten focused
pill tests pass, including synthetic egui biography rendering/keyboard navigation,
the source-byte boundary, and distinct thread/post labels in every language.
Formatting and strict workspace Clippy pass after the final translation fix.
The full workspace run at `f9e568c9` has 1,157 passes, the same eight baseline
failures, and 23 ignored tests; production-only and policy checks also pass.
The historical screenshots and process samples above were not repeated for
these review fixes; native input and capture remain unavailable.

The standard voice-inclusive package at `7d9c0d05` passed with no demo/developer
features. [review-package.json](review-package.json) records its sizes and SHA-256;
the [performance report](../../performance.md#review-follow-up-package) compares
it with the same baseline. NSIS remains unavailable locally; this is an unsigned
directory and ZIP, not an installer executable.

[Ubuntu CI at `7d9c0d05`](https://github.com/ViceVerse-cz/Serein/actions/runs/37639466527/job/112854794590)
also failed on those same eight baseline UI tests (415 passed, 8 failed, 5 ignored).
CodeRabbit approved the runtime changes and all five review threads were resolved;
that approval does not waive the test and native-verification blockers.

## Reply message links (2026-10-08)

The reply preview now uses the same channel, forum/post and foreign-server
destination metadata as the main message. Named links and code remain literal;
the existing 120-character preview limit includes the semantic icon prefix.
The icon background is painted at its actual size instead of using the enlarged
blank font glyph that reserves its width.

The new `channel-link-replies` page contains four synthetic original/reply pairs.
Baseline `d2299412` was built with only this fixture added, before the runtime
edit. `reply-before.png` / `reply-after.png` use 1120x900 dark; the
`reply-*-light-narrow.png` pair uses 720x900 light. All four framebuffer exports
were inspected, including the long Czech/Japanese post title and narrow reply
truncation. Build and run with the commands above, replacing `channel-links`
with `channel-link-replies`. These are eframe/WGPU exports, not OS captures.
The installed native helper still reports `failed to connect native pipe:
The system cannot find the file specified. (os error 2)`.

The new regression first failed against the baseline raw URL, then passed for
both themes, known/unknown destinations, literal/named links and Unicode bounds.
The final UI suite has 418 passes, the same eight recorded baseline failures,
and five ignored tests. The final serial `cargo xtask check` reached 1,158 passes,
eight baseline failures and 23 ignored tests; formatting and strict workspace
Clippy passed. An earlier parallel run stopped on an unrelated desktop audio
timeout, which passed both its focused serial retry and this final full run.
Policy checks also passed. [reply-checks.json](reply-checks.json) records the
results. No live Discord, native input or screen-reader verification was performed.

The same `sample-process.ps1` was copied locally with its page changed to
`channel-link-replies`. The matched runs use the same host, renderer, 125% scale,
five-second warmup and 21 samples as above, with 20.315 s baseline and 20.268 s
changed sampling windows. The binaries were rebuilt and preserved separately.
Concurrent compiler activity and OS residency introduce noise; this single idle
series establishes no CPU or memory improvement. Working set rose 6.58%, while
private bytes stayed approximately flat. See `reply-*-process.json` and
`reply-process-summary.json` for the counters.

| Process metric | Baseline | After | Delta | Method |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| CPU, one-core percentage | 0.692% | 0.000% | -0.692 percentage points | Process CPU delta / elapsed time |
| Peak working set | 200,089,600 B | 213,258,240 B | +13,168,640 B / +6.58% | WorkingSet64 maximum |
| Settled working set | 200,089,600 B | 213,257,421 B | +13,167,821 B / +6.58% | WorkingSet64 mean of last five samples |
| Settled private bytes | 416,260,096 B | 416,219,136 B | -40,960 B / -0.010% | PrivateMemorySize64 mean of last five samples |

The fresh standard voice-inclusive package passed after the final reply painting
fix, without demo/developer features. Its comparison uses the historical
`7d9c0d05` package recorded above: the runtime source at that commit is identical
to pre-fix `d2299412`, with only four documentation files changed in between.
This is not a fresh simultaneous package baseline. See
[reply-package.json](reply-package.json) for the new sizes and executable hash.

| Package metric | Historical baseline | Reply fix | Delta | Method |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Executable | 85,464,576 B | 85,465,088 B | +512 B / +0.0006% | serein.exe file length |
| Installed files | 89,638,189 B | 89,638,701 B | +512 B / +0.0006% | Sum of dist file lengths |
| ZIP distribution | 49,781,661 B | 49,781,875 B | +214 B / +0.0004% | Compress-Archive, Optimal; ZIP file length |

NSIS remains unavailable, so the result is an unsigned directory and ZIP.
The existing OpenH264 duplicate-object debug-info linker warning remains.
