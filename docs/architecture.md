# Architecture

Serein is a desktop protocol client for Discord, with no project messaging service. The final owner revisions permit an authentication-only webview, saved login, and local caches.

Incoming typing has its own eight-slot lossy inbox, separate from reliable message events.
The producer filters the selected channel and limits duplicate/burst wakeups to eight per two
seconds. The consumer collects reliable events first, then typing, and applies typing before
reliable events so queued messages and access changes retire older indicators. Core state is
eight fixed identity/deadline slots, scoped to fresh readable text history, with no persistence.
The composer schedules one visible expiry deadline and performs no animation or identity fetch.

- `model`: IDs preserved as strings on the wire / u64 in memory, typed entities and absent/null/value patches. No GUI, filesystem or networking.
- `discord-protocol`: bounded wire decoding and Discord DTOs, independent of rendering.
- `client-core`: single UI-thread state owner, generation-tagged events, composer/send lifecycle, navigation and freshness. Network callbacks never mutate it directly.
- `session-cache`: one active 500-message / 4 MiB timeline, bounded patches/tombstones. Inactive history goes to `local-store`; no unbounded RAM cache per channel.
- `discord-api`: fixed Discord origin, verified TLS, no redirects or cookies, direct routing unless an explicitly granted API Proxy plugin selects a route, four concurrent REST permits, bounded response bodies and conservative shared service cooldown.
- `discord-gateway`: independent Tokio task; JSON without compression, Hello/ACK/heartbeats, Identify/Resume, bounded initial login retries and persistent reconnection with capped backoff after READY. UI queue overload stops the connection instead of silently losing message mutations.
- `local-store`: SQLite transactions, global disk ceilings, account-isolated messages/drafts. A dedicated worker serializes operations away from rendering.
- `platform`: OS credential store, temporary Wry login webview and native file-save dialog. No system profile/token extraction. Credential operations are serialized by a dedicated worker to order saves before logout deletion.
- `ui`: egui panels, viewport virtualization and multiline composition; typed commands only. No network requests or tokens.
- `apps/desktop`: wiring, cancellation, bounded queues, native login lifecycle, cache hydration and eframe options. `test-support` is explicitly synthetic; `xtask` and `replay-bench` are development tools.

No generic plugin system, bot SDK or external database is introduced. The `discord-voice` crate provides native DM and guild media in every desktop build.

Loaded threads reuse channel models, selection and history. READY and thread dispatches supply validated guild/parent metadata; the core reconciles scoped active snapshots atomically before removing missing active threads. Removed selected conversations cancel pending history/search and invalidate visible/cache state while preserving drafts. The sidebar builds a bounded two-level parent/thread index with root fallback for malformed parents. Explicit archive browsing shares search/pins' single replaceable read worker and admits at most one transient navigation entry on Open. Active snapshot omission preserves that archived entry; matching Gateway metadata can adopt it. Sidebar forum discovery shares the existing active-post loader for the displayed guild, with one page in flight and at most 200 posts per forum. No subscription expansion is introduced.

The storage worker admits at most 16 operations within a 16 MiB estimated allocation budget; history payloads retain the active 4 MiB window limit. Its 16-result queue has a separate 16 MiB budget, including results being processed by the UI. A worker can hold one additional completed result while waiting for byte capacity. Admission failures retain the existing visible unsaved/cleanup handling. Authenticated REST has four permits and a shared cooldown; the cooldown mutex protects admission state rather than the lifetime of a slow response. Gateway control runs independently, and newer navigation cancels old history work. One separate profile task is cancelled by a replacement profile request, closing the card or connection teardown. Profile responses match the session generation and selected user/guild/request before entering the single 64 KiB RAM view. A separate 16-slot serial message-write worker keeps slow REST writes from blocking call controls. Explicit message sends can use that worker during a transient Gateway outage, gated by authenticated identity and last known channel permissions; attachment uploads still wait for the Gateway. Sends are single-attempt and ambiguous outcomes are never replayed. A coalesced recovery request from Refresh, Reconnect now or an explicit send interrupts Gateway waits/backoff after the initial READY, preserving the Resume session and leaving REST writes running. Session generations reject old outcomes. Credential queues are four small operations and serialize read/save/delete. UI snapshots do not clone the account per frame.

Incremental history saves borrow their loaded channel rows and changed messages rather than
cloning the window, and reuse a prepared write statement. Unchanged rows need no serialization
or write. Transactional eviction uses occupied SQLite pages as a cheap lower-pressure check,
then sums stored payload bytes when occupied pages exceed the history budget. No persistent
counter or schema migration is introduced.
Signed uploads reuse a separate credential-free HTTP client with their existing timeouts and
single-attempt policy; REST bodies reserve bounded capacity from a validated Content-Length.

The native message renderer uses pulldown-cmark without its HTML or command-line features. Parsing is capped at 8192 UTF-8 bytes / 128 lines, 512 parser events and 16 nesting levels; complexity overflow falls back to bounded literal text. A 512-entry / 1 MiB estimated source-and-span MRU serves visible messages. HTML remains inert text and Markdown images are placeholders. Named links to exact
public Discord emoji/sticker artwork routes render through the existing bounded media
worker and remain editable links in the composer. HTTP(S) links require an explicit destination confirmation; nothing fetches them for previews. Up to 32 inline spoiler regions use a fixed reveal mask; concealed spans never enter text selection, accessibility labels, link/reference actions or emoji rendering. Spoiler media has a separate explicit reveal. Consent is invalidated when the original text or media changes. Complexity fallback conservatively conceals bounded source containing spoiler markers. Spoiler consent copies are bounded by the active message window. Native height caches include message content/metadata, width, body font size and display scale.

Bundled OFL Noto CJK/Arabic fallbacks add 16.51 MiB raw font data, without runtime downloads.
Eframe separately enumerates installed system fonts on a background thread for missing glyphs,
including native color emoji. See assets/README.md for provenance, regional forms and shaping limitations.

History responses/errors must match the active request and connection state. Recent reload replaces the retained view while preserving mutations observed during the request; back-pagination validates page channel, ID boundary, duplicates and cardinality. At capacity, an older window retains its reading position instead of evicting its anchor for new messages; Reload returns to latest. Successful Resume triggers active-page revalidation. A REST history response received during a Gateway outage completes as stale rather than remaining stuck loading. Bulk deletions occupy one bounded event instead of flooding the UI queue.

Known limits: one RAM channel window, a CommonMark subset rather than Discord Markdown parity, conservative shared rate cooldown, six initial connection attempts (established sessions keep retrying outages with a delay capped at 32 seconds plus jitter), and full-window cache writes rather than per-message SQL updates. These are implementation limits, not claims of full milestone completion.

The active People pane retains at most 100 service list positions and 128 KiB of member metadata. DM participants are retained with navigation; guild member subscriptions are on demand and remain unofficial/live-unverified. Member events are tagged with the active request and matched to the service list identity; closing or navigating the pane releases its working set.

Avatar metadata travels through user/message DTOs and SQLite alongside embeds, attachments, mentioned users and unsupported-content presence bits. A credential-free worker constructs Discord CDN image URLs from validated IDs/hashes and validates service-proxied message image URLs, disables redirects/proxy discovery, and does disk I/O and bounded decoding away from the render thread. The UI requests visible images and deduplicates attempts; avatars, emoji and message media have separate bounded working sets. Eight download/decode jobs can overlap per worker. Blocking image decoders share eight process-wide admission slots across worker replacement; running closures retain their slots even when their async waiters are aborted. Decoded results share a 128-item / 128 MiB allocation budget through UI consumption; active decoders and completed jobs waiting for admission are additional. Account cache directories can retain 1 GiB / 4096 encoded images. See storage-policy.md for exact queue/decoder limits and cleanup ordering.

The image viewer is a full-window egui modal. It draws the file at its own pixel size when that fits the window, and it fits a larger file to the window. The texture request follows the size ladder and stops at the file's longest side, up to 4096. Scroll zoom can enlarge past the file size. Message and embed pictures use a separate `MediaLibrary` working set. See storage-policy.md for those ceilings. Explicit Download uses a separate credential-free client and a single worker, after a native destination choice. Only the selected CDN attachment original is streamed; no message filename becomes a path without native user selection. Progress is coalesced, transfer bytes are bounded at 100 MiB, and filesystem writes/flush/cleanup run off the render thread. A sibling partial is published only on complete success; cancellation and ordinary shutdown wait for cleanup. Native Cocoa/Windows dialogs and the Linux FileChooser portal are provided by rfd; Linux avoids a second GTK owner competing with the login webview. Download guarantees and limitations are strictly enforced.

## Native DM and server voice

`client-core::voice` owns one active call and one incoming indicator, with generation/request matching and no automatic answer/rejoin. Existing kind-1 DMs with one recipient, kind-3 group DMs with fewer than 64 recipients, and guild voice channels are eligible. `discord-protocol` decodes CALL_* and voice state/server dispatches; `discord-gateway` sends the unofficial normal-user opcodes 13/4. Leaving retains a barrier until the owner's null voice state or CALL_DELETE acknowledges departure; after ten seconds it reports a timeout and continues rejecting another join until acknowledgment or reconnect. An old departure cannot become the next call's negotiation event.

The desktop consumes redacted, zeroizing voice credentials before core reduction. It pairs the owner's session with a channel-scoped voice server/token, bounded by a 30-second allocation deadline. Outgoing ringing is a separate, once-per-request REST command after transport allocation is confirmed, before waiting for the peer-dependent DAVE group. Answer never rings. Failed/ambiguous ringing writes are not replayed. Slow REST cannot block native mute or hangup; call control and notice queues each hold eight items.

`discord-voice` owns the voice WebSocket, public-address UDP discovery, RTP transport authentication, DAVE/OpenMLS state, Opus and native CPAL audio. TLS/origin validation and required DAVE readiness gate media; there is no encryption downgrade. Audio callbacks use preallocated rings, while codecs/networking and device work run off the render thread. Capture/playback are enabled only after required encryption, and stop on hangup, session failure or account change. The desktop polls media lifecycle from eframe logic as well as after UI gestures, so teardown and focused push-to-talk do not depend on a visible repaint.

Device choices, mute/deafen and focused V push-to-talk remain session-local. Voice WebSocket resumption is bounded and preserves the current call's cryptographic state; rejected resumption and main Gateway disconnect require deliberate rejoin. Group calls share the bounded media engine, AEC, camera and screen-sharing paths; recording is not included. Exact media limits and offline evidence are in [the adapter README](../crates/discord-voice/README.md); [the live gate](voice.md) is still blocked.

Conversation search owns one page of at most 25 ID/author/excerpt records plus bounded mentioned-user metadata, capped at 256 KiB, alongside the existing 500-message / 4 MiB timeline. Queries are capped at 256 characters / 1024 UTF-8 bytes. The decoder caps the HTTP body at 512 KiB, 25 result groups and 5 context records per group; only the matching 8 KiB excerpt and its at most 100 mentioned users are retained. Snippets reuse bounded message formatting without entering the message cache or loading a member directory. One cancellable read task shares the four REST permits. Opening a result replaces the active window with revalidated history rather than merging index snapshots into the message cache; the completed search page remains open. Numbered pages replace that same result slot with offsets capped at 9,975, retaining only fixed-size offset and total metadata.


Application components reuse bounded model/protocol records and the serial REST write
worker. The connection adapter intercepts the zeroized Gateway session handoff; the
UI never receives it. Core state authorizes explicit component selections, validates
modal inputs against the received schema, correlates nonce-tagged outcomes and retires
stale/session-changed forms. Private replies bypass persistent timeline state. Native
file dialogs stage modal uploads separately from composer attachments, through the
existing upload worker. No bot credentials, backend or embedded messaging webview is
introduced. Normal-account interaction behavior remains unofficial and live-unverified.

Profile private-note reads use one independent cancellable task and a separate request identity; they do not reserve the account-write slot or disable profile messaging. Gateway note updates and confirmed local note saves win over older read responses. Closing the profile cancels its read.
